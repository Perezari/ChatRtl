Easily switch your conversation's text direction between Left-to-Right (LTR) and Right-to-Left (RTL) on popular AI chat platforms with just one click or a quick keyboard shortcut. This browser extension enhances your chat experience, especially for users who prefer or require RTL text alignment.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Effortless Direction Toggle:** Instantly switch between LTR and RTL text alignment in your chat conversations.
*   **One-Click Convenience:** A dedicated button is injected into the UI of supported platforms for quick toggling.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Currently supports conversations on:
    *   **ChatGPT** (`chatgpt.com`)
    *   **DeepSeek Chat** (`chat.deepseek.com`)
*   **Persistent State:** Your preferred text direction is automatically saved and restored when you revisit the page.
*   **Keyboard Shortcut:** For an even faster experience on ChatGPT, toggle RTL/LTR mode using the `Alt + Shift` keyboard combination.
*   **Multilingual Support:** The extension is localized and supports English, Hebrew (he), Farsi (fa), and Arabic (ar) for its interface elements.
*   **Custom Button Design:** Integrates seamlessly with a custom-styled button on ChatGPT for a polished look and feel.

## üìö Tech Stack

*   **JavaScript:** Core logic for injecting CSS, manipulating the DOM, and handling user interactions.
*   **CSS:** Dynamically injected to control text direction and visual styles.
*   **HTML:** Minimal inline HTML for the toggle button.
*   **Chrome Extension API:** Utilizes `manifest_version 3` for content scripts and resource management.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once installed, navigate to one of the supported chat platforms:

*   **ChatGPT:** `https://chatgpt.com/*`
*   **DeepSeek Chat:** `https://chat.deepseek.com/*`

1.  **Using the Toggle Button:** Look for a newly added button, typically near the chat input area. Clicking this button will switch the conversation's text direction.
2.  **Using the Keyboard Shortcut (ChatGPT Only):** Press `Alt + Shift` on your keyboard to quickly toggle between LTR and RTL modes.

The selected text direction will persist even if you refresh the page or close and reopen the tab.
